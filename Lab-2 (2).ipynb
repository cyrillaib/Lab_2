    "You are currently reading text that was entered into a Markdown cell. In this class we will be using **Markdown cells** (where you can redact text using Markdown styling) and **Code cells** (where you can write Python code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, in a standard Python script (.py file), we would use the hash symbol (#) at the start of a line where we wanted to add a comment to our code. However, the Markdown cells in Jupyter notebooks allow you to go a step further by making comments more readable and elaborate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can create a new cell by hitting the **+** icon at the top-left of the notebook tab window (or by pressing **a** when no cells are selected).\n",
    "- When adding a cell, a Code cell is created by default, but you can convert this cell into a Markdown cell by selecting *Markdown* from the dropdown menu at the top of the notebook tab window while the cell is selected (or you can just press **m** with the cell selected).\n",
    "- After having edited a cell, you can press **Shift+Enter** or **Ctrl/Cmd+Enter** to run the cell (or you can use the play button at the top of the tab window). This will **render** the Markdown text if it is a Markdown cell, or it will **run** the Python script if it is Code cell.\n",
    "- To edit a rendered Markdown cell, double-click on it (try double-clicking on this one).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note as well that the directory in which the present notebook (.ipynb file) is located is visible on the left pane (if viewing on your browser). Using this directory, you can open files within JupyterLab: your entire workspace (files and folders inside your current directory) is technically accessible from within JupyterLab, so if that simplifies things for you, then use it!\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on Jupyter, see the [official documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html) and this [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5YyoCKxEOU&ab_channel=Jupyter%2FIPython). For more on running cells and some of the intricacies involving code execution order, [watch this video](https://youtu.be/oJ6z02N0Te0?t=330) from 00:05:30 onward, which highlights some issues you will definitely face as your notebooks become more elaborate!"

    ">Python is dynamically typed, meaning that any variable can be assigned any value. There are no type declarations. A variable that holds an integer can then be assigned a string, for example. Primitive types include integers, floats, strings (both single-byte and Unicode), and booleans (with literals True and False). Built-in container types include lists, dictionaries, and classes. ([source](https://pyhurry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first.html#types))\n",

    "- Use underscores in place of spaces.\n",
    "- Name variables descriptively.\n",
    "- Do not start variable name with a number.\n",

    "You're at a new job with Via Rail, and you're pretty good at Python. You have been given a messy inventory of stations by a supervisor for the entirety of Canada. The supervisor isn't data legible and doesn't realize how much of a mess the data are. They have a cartography intern who isn't very savvy and would like a list of cities without the state name (or any other clutter that may be associated) to be used as labels for their hopefully good looking PDF maps... Even though this mapmaker could probably figure this out themselves, they clearly can't! Further, since interns come and go, the next intern might ask this of you again for another map in a couple months. Also, you can't guarantee that stations will always be in the same cities, especially given a recent boost in federal funding towards passenger rail infrastructure, it's likely that the number of stations will change over time.\n",

    "You conclude that you should write a small script that can handle new incoming data and output clean city names for these ineffective mapping interns, but also to clean up the messy data you are regularly receiving from your clumsy supervisor so you can do more effective analyses with them. Basically, you will write a small algorithm that will automate a simple data wrangling task, mostly involving strings.\n",

Basically, if you have created some clutter (notes, subdirectories) in your local repository, or your code has generated some unwanted files you prefer not to share to your public repository hosted on GitHub, then you can tell git to ignore these inside a *.gitignore* file. This file needs to be located at the root directory of your repository (i.e. not inside a subdirectory).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a *.gitignore* file, you can do the following (some commands might be slightly different if you are in DOS):\n",
    "- `touch .gitignore` to create the file\n",
    "- `ls` to view your file in the directory\n",

    "\n",
    "- To edit your *.gitignore* file, open it in the text editor of your choice (if you are willing to do this directly from within the console, you can type `vi .gitignore` to open the file in Vim). If you want to use another text editor that you cannot access directly through a command, you will need to navigate to your directory and open it from outside the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your *.gitignore file*, you can basically write out each file you would like to ignore on a separate line. If you wanted to ignore an entire folder, then you just need to write the folder name followed by a forward slash (*/*).\n",
    "\n",
    "In my case, I would like git to ignore my virtual environment folder, which I happened to have created inside my repo. I would also like it to ignore the *.ipynb_checkpoints* folder that was created automatically by JupyterLab.\n",
